draft feature specs

# Feature Spec Format

### 1. Motivation

* Short description of what the feature is about and what it intends to achieve.

### 2. Designs

* Links to figma designs

### 3. Use cases

* See [Cockburn style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case#Cockburn_style)

### 4. Functional requirements

* See [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)
* Specifications SHOULD use formal technical language (different from academic language).
* Where appropriate, language SHOULD NOT use personal pronouns.
* Avoid using the passive voice when being specific.
* In places where the passive voice is appropriate but makes the subject ambiguous, append the passive voice with “by subject”. Alternatively restructure the sentence to be in the active voice adding the sentence subject.

### 5. Notes

* Anything that should be noted/one should be aware of (security, possible needed API changes etc)
* Additional notes that might be relevant
